# export-storygraph
A Firefox and Chrome extension that lets you export your StoryGraph lists.

I wanted to be able to send my mom my To-Read list on StoryGraph because she wanted to know what to get me for Christmas.
I quickly ran into numerous difficulties:

1. Sending a link to her would not work, as StoryGraph requires users to log into an account to view a To-Read pile.
2. There is no feature to export the To-Read pile, or any other list of books, to a human-readbale format.
3. Suggesting features requires a premium subscription, and there is no guarantee that the devs will implement your suggestion.

Thus, I learned how to make Firefox and Chrome extension and made this.

Right now the extension will export your to-read pile, your owned books, or your read books in a human-readable format
to your clipboard or to a TXT file. The roadmap for this project is as follows:

- Allow for export to CSV.
- Try to automatically scroll to the bottom of the page for the user.
- Make the checkboxes persist each time you open the popup.
