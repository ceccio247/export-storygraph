# export-storygraph
A Firefox extension that lets you export your StoryGraph To-Read pile.

I wanted to be able to send my mom my To-Read list on StoryGraph because she wanted to know what to get me for Christmas.
I quickly ran into numerous difficulties:

1. Sending a link to her would not work, as StoryGraph requires users to log into an account to view a To-Read pile.
2. There is no feature to export the To-Read pile, or any other list of books, to a human-readbale format.
3. Suggesting features requires a premium subscription, and there is no garauntee that the devs will implement your suggestion.

Thus, I learned how to make a Firefox extension and made this.

Right now the extension will export *only* the To-Read pile in a human-readable format to your clipboard,
where it can then be pasted into the text editor of your choosing. The roadmap for this project is as follows:

- Include more information in the exported data.
- Allow the user to directly download the exported file in addition to exporting to clipboard.
- Allow for export to CSV.
- Expand the system to export other parts of StoryGraph, like owned books.
- Add a checkbox system where the user can decide what data they want to export.
